## 2. Executive Summary (Criteria 8)
This report presents an in-depth analysis of the exponential distribution using the R programming language, with a specific focus on its comparison to the Central Limit Theorem. We conducted 1000 simulations with a rate parameter (lambda) set at 0.2. Through this analysis, we compare the theoretical mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution (1/lambda) with the theoretical mean and standard deviation of the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials.
